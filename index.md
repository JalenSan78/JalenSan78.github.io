# This Is My Coding Journey!

This is my very own homepage where I intend to show you what I've accomplished throughout my experiences while coding. My name is Jalen Sanchez and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/). I major in computer science if that wasn't obvious enough from me creating this webpage. I will make sure to upload any future projects here to show all my credentials and have a reference to come back to often.

## Computer Science Projects

My github projects are located [here](https://github.com/JalenSan78).

### *CPSC 120*

*Lab 4

 This lab was my favorite because of both parts. Once I was done with part 1 I took it and used it with all my friends to show them how old they were in days. It was pretty simple just using Cin Cout statements. In part two I learned a deeper understanding of how to incorporate int and doubles into my code. It took me hours to figure out this part but it was super rewarding to know that I could code it as long as I stayed diligent and dedicated.

*Lab 6

 I liked this particular lab because of part one where we printed a simple pattern made of lines and asterisks. I like it because it was fun to tackle this with my partner for the first time without needing help from the TA. I felt like I was finally getting good at writing for and while loops as we finished in 30 minutes, which was fast for us at the time.

*Lab 8

 In lab 8 I liked the third part where we got to test our code many times with different ASCII animations. I know I didn't create the actual animations but it still felt good to finally get them to appear in my terminal. I accomplished this by reading into file, getting the characters then printing them into the terminal. Reading and writing into files was kinda the theme for this particular lab.

This is all I have to share for now. Hope you enjoyed!
